This is a combination of a FRSky D4R-II wit a openXvario directly connected to it.
Doesn't add much size and weight, but quite a bit of funtionality.

  * ALT => the relative altitude
  * VSpd => the vertical speed
  * Dist => 279.22 the absolute height as calculated form air pressure+temp
  * Cels => the input voltage of the arduino
  * RPM => 1056 mbar = the current air pressure (not the best resolution in this field...)
  * T1 => 25C the temperature measured by the ms5611

the dist and RPM fields are being "misused" a bit here :D

you can configure this to your liking by just uncommenting some lines in the code.
e.g. you can choose what you want in the dist or RPM field: nothing, Altitude,Air pressure..
